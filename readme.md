# Simple TCP Redirect Using Python (pydivert)

This uses a simple TCP redirect to redirect traffic from a port to another port or maybe another IP.

I tried to use this for a game called Ragnarok Online.

I was able to alter the packets but server anti-cheat detected the change.

I was kicked from the server. But I was able to connect again.
